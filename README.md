This project was my first dive into JavaScript. It feels like I learned a lot over these past few days. I found that I was trying to solve problems in ways that we haven't learned yet in TOP (loops and arrays) so I got a little tripped up. I kept trying to do things that I simply did not have the knowledge of yet. This made the project seem much harder than it actually was.

Once I realized the project is mostly there for you to practice conditional statements, things started moving along much faster.

I most definitely over-commented! But I guess that is what learning looks like.
